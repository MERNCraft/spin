# CSS-only Slot Machine #

[Demo](https://MERNCraft.github.io/spin)

This project simulates a slot machine, using the `@counter-style` at-rule to create custom list counters, the `transform: rotateX()` property, and some simple arithmetic to calculate how much to rotate each list item and which item number symbols to display.

The symbols are created using Unicode emojis.

The page detects when you have clicked any two of the Spin buttons and hides the third Spin button to reveal a `.final.button` beneath it. This previously hidden button triggers a different animation for the fruit machine's final reel, and which animates the Smiley character.
